## About

The game is inspired by classic shoot 'em ups like Space Invaders, R-Type and Gradius, and was built entirely for the terminal using ncurses. We wrote it mostly in C, with some C++.

The project was made in a setting which we at 42 Vienna call a *Rush* - we randomly get put into teams of 2-3 peers and have exactly 2 days and 5 hours.

## Features

- **Terminal-based gameplay** using ncurses library
- **3 Enemy types and 1 Boss** with different bullets and movement patterns
- **Game area adjusts to terminal size** - keep it small for easier gameplay
